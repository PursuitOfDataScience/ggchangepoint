Combines Changepoint Anaysis with 'ggplot2'.
}
\details{
ggchangepoint tries to offer several changepoint R packages in a tidy
format and output the ggplot2 plots so that the tidyverse users can gain some
familiarity to work with the changepoint analysis. For the moment, I only
include three changepoint packages ('changepoint', 'changepoint.np' and 'ecp'
). More changepoint packages will be included as time progresses.
