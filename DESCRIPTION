Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
    c(person(given = "Youzhi",
             family = "Yu",
             role = c("aut", "cre"),
             email = "yuyouzhi666@icloud.com"))
Description: R provides fantastic tools for changepoint
    analysis, but plots generated by using the tools do 
    not have the 'ggplot2' style. This tool, however, 
    combines 'changepoint', 'changepoint.np', and 'ecp'
    together and using 'ggplot2' to visualize changepoints.
